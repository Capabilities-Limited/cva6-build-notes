# Building and Running FreeRTOS on CVA6 on the Genesys 2

## Building a Bitfile

First, build a bitfile according to the instructions given in [the CVA6 VM from Scratch notes](https://github.com/Capabilities-Limited/cva6-build-notes/blob/main/cva6-vm-from-scratch-notes.md).

Second, program the FPGA with your bitfile according to [the instructions in the CVA6 repository](https://github.com/Capabilities-Limited/cva6?tab=readme-ov-file#programming-the-memory-configuration-file).


## Running on FPGA

Follow the instructions in [the FreeRTOS Demo repository](https://github.com/Capabilities-Limited/FreeRTOS-Partner-Supported-Demos/tree/cva6/RISC-V_cva6).
